### Binary Search

The binary search is a algorithm to find a given value on a sorted array; It's a `O(log n)`.

It identify the init and the end of array, create a manual slice catching the middle number.

I wanna search by number `60`

```
lower = 0   middle=2   higher=4
[ 10 , 30 , 53 , 60 , 90 ]
```

whatever, get that
